---

Waukesha WI- Darrell E Brooks, who was charged and found guilty of:

* Six counts of First-Degree Intentional Homicide
* Sixty-one counts of Reckless Endangerment
* Six counts of Hit and Run causing death
* Two counts of Bail Jumping
* One count of Misdemeanor Battery

Brooks was given SIX life sentences with no chance of parole and Seven hundred or more years on top to be served consecutively.

Judge Jennifer Dorow leaving Brookes with a stern memory 

>"This community can only be safe if you are behind bars for the rest of your life" - Judge Dorow


We send prayers to the family and freinds of the people who were harmed or affected in the attack and now hope the healing process can fully begin knowing justice has been served and the Brookes will no longer see freedom in his life time.
