# What is Hack The Box?
---
This is post one of this series of Hack the Box


Best way I know to explain what HTB (Hack The Box) is that its a site to practice hacking into virtual boxes using various methods. Hack The Box provides you with an IP address to one of their machines running and its your job to, as the title says, hack the box. 

They have diffrent levels of difficulty ranging from easy to very hard and also offer a beginning course for noobies like me.

Now if your just starting out like me youll have the choice to use thier provided browser based VM of Pwnbox for an hour or you can either use your own machine or spin up your own Virtual Machine. I strongly reccomend using a VM to practice on Hack The Box.


# What do you need to begin?
---
Well if you go the route I did...

* You'll need a computer for one, preferably something with enough power to run a VM of Kali Linux.

* You'll need a VM software:  Either VMware, Virtual Box, Qemu...
 to actually run the VM on. Im using VMware for mine

 * A copy of Kali Linux or Parrot OS (both are free and open source)

### Why Linux?
---
Well the reason we are using linux as opposed to...lets say... Windows 10 is because Linux has the open end supoort and open source nature that gives us , the user, the ability to make any distro of linux what we want.

For example if im tired of the way my current desktop enviroment is rn on Ubuntu, I can simply install a new one and it will work almost native.

Linux allows us to do things Windows or Mac keeps locked away.

# What do I do now?
---
Well after your setup you uh well...Hack The Box

Dont worry you wont be going in alone HTB offers training and much more to learn how to pen test and other things like that.
