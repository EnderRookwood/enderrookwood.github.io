# The Start
----
When I started making this site, im not gonna lie, I had alot of issues...
Mostly of my own fault but still.

Alot of errors and cussing later i finally have a website up and running and posting stuff!!

I extend alot of that to google and Stackflow XD.
They helped alot in figuring out how to format the .md files for posts and other things.

# Using Windows Subsytem for Linux
---

So for pushing things to github im using Windows Subsystem for linux to emulate a linux terminal and so far i have to give it windows for making it really simple to install it. 


If you want a linux style terminal while keeping Windows 10 (or 11 if you use it) I really reccommend WSL Ubuntu.
